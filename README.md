# Tailwind Challenge
This is the starter code for the Tailwind Challenge assignment.

## Objective
Reinforced practice of Tailwind's class styling system. HTML trial by fire. Referencing documentation under pressure.

## Rules
1. Create a new project that contains ONE PAGE in a file named index.html that successfully implements the layout shown in the wireframes in the img directory. This layout should be fully responsive, and conform to the mobile layout on small devices.
2. Use Tailwind's built-in classes to create the layout, style and responsive design in wire frames.
3. Use whatever content, placeholder images and text you want.
4. You can copy snippets from the Tailwind Official Documentation where you need to, BUT no copy/pasting from pre-built templates, other websites, or existing projects! The challenge here is to create this layout from scratch.
5. Load dependencies according to the instructions in Tailwind's documentation.

Use the Tailwind documentation freely. Do not use example projects, pre-built templates, tutorials, or third-party code snippets as a head start. All of your new co-workers will know if you do.

**Code taken from the official Tailwind documentation and CDN links excepted.**
